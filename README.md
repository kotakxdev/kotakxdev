# Hi, I'm Harsh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a systems-focused engineer (Ex-Apple, Ex-Intel), currently on a deliberate break â€” rebuilding from first principles.
### ðŸŽ¯ What Iâ€™m doing now:
- Sharpening skills in **DSA**, **System Design**, and **OS Internals**
- Exploring **AI/ML fundamentals** and how to build scalable AI systems
- Building side projects + tracking execution here

ðŸ“« _Letâ€™s connect once thereâ€™s something worth showing off. Until then â€” building quietly._
